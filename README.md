# Apache Airflow Practice DAGs

This repository contains example DAGs I built while learning Apache Airflow.

## Included DAGs

- **executing_multiple_tasks.py** – Demonstrates task dependencies using BashOperator.
  
Each DAG can be run locally in Airflow.  

### Concepts covered:
- DAG scheduling and dependencies  
- Upstream/Downstream task relationships  
- BashOperator commands  
- Use of `with DAG` context manager
